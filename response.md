1. First, I chose a word. Then, I converted into its ascii form as hexadecimal. I then converted from its hexadecimal form to its binary form. I did the same step to the secret key of converting into is binary form. I then performed the XOR bitwise operation to encrypt it. To decrypt it, do the XOR bitwise operator with the encrypted form and with its secret key. You will get back your secret word.
2. Some challenges I faced during the lab was converting the word from ascii to its number and then having to convert to its binary form. Another challenge was perfoeming the XOR operator because I had to compare each bit and see its output.
3. encryption: Secret message: Robert, convert it to hexadecimal from ASCII: 52,6F,62,65,72,74. Convert it to binary form: 01010010, 01101111, 01100010, 01100101, 01110010, 01110100. For secret key: secret, convert it to hexadecimal form from ascii: 73, 65, 63, 72, 65, 74. Convert to binary form: 01110011, 01100101, 01100011, 01110010, 01100101, 01110100. Perform bitwise XOR operator between secret word and secret key to encrypt: 00100001, 00001010, 000000001, 00010111, 00010111, 00000000, its hexadecomal form: 21, 0A, 01, 17, 17, 00
4. decryption: perform the XOR operator using encrypted message and secret key: encrypted message in binary form: 00010001, 00001010, 00000001, 00010111, 00010111, 00000000. Secret key in binary form: 01110011, 01100101, 01100011, 01110010, 01100101, 01110100. Using XOR operator for both: 01010100, 01101111, 01100010, 01100101, 01110010, 01110100. Converting it to hexadecomal form: 52, 6F, 62, 65, 72, 74. Converting it back to its ascii form from hexadecimal: Robert.
